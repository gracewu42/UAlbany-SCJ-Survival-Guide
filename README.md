# Commuting

## By bus

- Taking a bus is free using your UAlbany ID card
- Check the school bus schedule [here](https://www.albany.edu/pmts/bus_schedules.php).

## By car

- Parking on campus is extremely cheap. This year with a discount the price is $50 (it's usually $60+). It can easy go up to $500 in other universities I know. 
- You can purchase your parking permit online via the University [Parking & Mass Transit Services](https://epay.albany.edu/C21455_ustores/web/store_cat.jsp?STOREID=1&CATID=3).
- If you unfortunately get a parking ticket ($40-$50 fine), going to the city hall and making your argument may reduce the fine. 

# Paychecks and budgeting

## Stipend

Most PhD students work as TA or RA. Graduate TA/RA stipends go through university payroll, processed on Wednesdays every other week. 

- You can find the pay schedule via [Human Resources](https://www.albany.edu/hr/schedules-timesheets.php).
- It is recommend that you set up Direct Deposit so that you don't have to go to campus to collect your paycheck. You need to submit a **Direct Deposit Form** to HR to set it up. If you are off the payroll (i.e. not working) during summer, you need to submit a **Direct Deposit Reactivation form** before the beginning of the next academic year to receive your direct deposit payment for the new academic year. The forms can be found [here](https://www.albany.edu/hr/forms.php#Payroll).
- View your paycheck online [here](https://www.albany.edu/hr/view-pay.php).

## Health Insurance

- If you work as GA/TA, you will be enrolled in Student Employee Health Plan (SEHP).
- This is a very good health insurance program. It costs about $17 Bi-Weekly and this fee will be deducted from your Bi-Weekly paycheck. More information can be found [here](https://www.albany.edu/hr/GATA_SEHP.php).

## Student fees

- SCJ covers PhD students' tuition. But we still need to pay several hundred dollars of student fees (around $600+ for PhD students; $800+ for PhD international students; $100+ for PhD candidates; $300+ for international students who are PhD candidates). You will receive a bill from epay at the beginning of each semester. The payment due date is usually September 15 in Fall semester and January 15 in Spring semester. 
- Almost all student fees are mandatory, but the $30 Student Alumni Partnership fee is optional. You need to submit a [form](https://www.alumni.albany.edu/s/1642/bp19/interior.aspx?sid=1642&gid=2&pgid=558) to opt out if you don't want to pay this fee. 

## Taxes

- For international students, ISSS has purchased Sprintax to help you prepare your taxes. You can contact ISSS for a [Sprintax code](https://www.albany.edu/isss/68229.php). The code will pay for one 8843 form and one basic tax return. It will not cover your NY State tax return, meaning you need to pay $20+ for your state tax return. 

## Living expenses

| **Expense**       | **Period** | **Mean** | **Range**  |
| ----------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- |
| Rent              | Monthly    | $820     | $525-$1800 |
| Utilities         | Monthly    | $107     | $50-$270   |
| Renters Insurance | Monthly    | $15      |            |
| Internet & TV     | Monthly    | $60      |            |
| Car Insurance     | Monthly    | $200     |            |

Above are some estimates of common expenses. The estimates of rent and utilities are based on a small survey (n=15) of grad students in 2019. Other estimates are based on my personal experience and information provided by my landlord.

The 2019 survey also included additional general information/tips from the respondents:

- Highly recommend 1) living within walking distance of campus, 2) living with roommates, 3) starting a lease in June/July and not in August.
- If anyone is coming in with children, there are some great school districts in the Albany and surrounding areas to choose from!
- Try to avoid places that have "all utilities included" in the rent. It’s cheap for a reason.
- I live in a residential area where most others students do not live. It’s still convenient and I have bus access on snowy days.

Some local landlords (like Tri City Rentals, the Solomon Organization, etc.) offer referral programs. When a new resident submit the application and write down the name of a current resident as the referral person, the current resident can get money or promotion code. If you plan to live in or currently live in this kind of apartment, just ask around and see if you can benefit from the referral program. 

# Resources

## Funding opportunities

See this [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xx0gdM_Ik3XpALMsFIyS6TGs9bolyIv7OrHRoCZJnxY/edit?usp=sharing) for funding opportunities available to students. 

The first three grants are easily available to SCJ PhD students. 

I have no much experience with other fundings and grants (and that is why most cells are left blank). The links to these fundings and grants can provide you with more information.

## University Library

UAlbany library is not super powerful, but it still satisfies a lot of our research needs. You can find on the library website:

1. **Ebooks**, including many textbooks you need to read. For example, most of Paul Allison's little green stats books (*Fixed effects regression models*, *Missing data*, *Event history analysis*, etc.) are available online.
2. Most **journal articles** you need to read. 
3. **Databases** good for legal research like Westlaw. 
4. Databases of **streaming video services** like [Kanopy](https://apps.library.albany.edu/dbfinder/results.php?subject=streamingvideo) where you can watch movies like *Loving Vincent*, *Moonlight*, etc.

---

The Librarian working with SCJ faculty and students is Abby (aadams5@albany.edu). She can help us purchase book and ebooks. For example, if you are teaching your own course and want to use a certain textbooks, instead of instructing the students to order a copy in the University bookstore, you can contact Abby to purchase an E-copy that can be available to your students. She can also help you get familiar with other library resources like [Interlibrary Loan](https://library.albany.edu/ill/about) and citation tools.

---

You can also recommend the University library to purchase books by submitting a request [here](https://albany.libanswers.com/faq/282683). I used to recommend that the libary purchase a science fiction and they ordered it. According to my experience, the whole process takes about a month from submitting the request to item being available. 

## Books

You can always purchase the books you need on Amazon or in the bookstores. Below are some alternatives:

- If Ebooks are acceptable to you, always check on the library website whether the book you need is available online or not before you order it. It saves a lot of money.
- Ask former students in your class whether they can loan you the book you need. 
- [Dove & Hudson](https://goo.gl/maps/QvrJy6oq2defh2HB8) in downtown sells used books in a reasonable price. 
- [Thriftbooks](https://www.thriftbooks.com) is a good online store to get cheap used books (recommended by Colleen). 

---

If you want to get rid of your books, you can:

- Sell them online. [BookScouter](https://bookscouter.com) is a very useful website where you can find who will buy your books for how much. The selling process is very simple. You print the prepaid labels provided by the buyer, pack the books and drop them off in the courier, and get paid via PayPal. 
- Sell them or give them away to other students. 
- Donate them to the SCJ Lending Library in the second room of the computer lab (Draper 310).

## ITS

ITS provides:

- Free software! See the Catalog [here](https://wiki.albany.edu/display/public/askit/ITS+Software+Catalog). Normally ITS does not provide Adobe Acrobat Pro or Stata to students. But at least it always provides Office 365. 
- Technical support when you use the Blackboard, MyUAlbany, etc.

## Survey Tool: Qualtrics

The survey tool provided by the University is Qualtrics. You can launch Qualtrics [here](https://wiki.albany.edu/display/qualtrics/Qualtrics+Home). Qualtrics Support is amazing! They are professional and responsive (and reply emails even at 11:30 pm). 

## Other stuff

- SCJ computer lab (Draper 310, which is a great workplace!)
  - For Fall 2020, see Diana's email about the reservation of the computer lab. 
- SCJ writin circle
  - This is a great opportunity to receive feedback, help your peers improve their work, and see some friendly faces! During the meetings, participants will share writing samples that are 1-3 pages double-spaced. These pieces can be any kind of work you want feedback on, such as a couple of pages from a class paper, concept paper, prospectus, dissertation, journal article, cover letter, grant application, or syllabus. If the writing sample is not in double-spaced format (e.g., syllabus or cover letter), please keep the length roughly equivalent. The meetings should last no more than an hour and a half—this will depend on the group size. About 20 minutes will be spent on each writing sample -- 10 minutes to read the sample and 10 minutes to provide feedback on the sample.
- SCJ What's Going on
  - This is a student-only presentation opportunity. If you have an idea you want to workshop to people this is a good time for it. Or you can do a conference presentation. Idea pitches are usually about 10-15 minutes and presentations can be as long as 30 minutes with feedback.

## Food & Drink

- Popular grocery stores include Trader Joe's, Wholefoods, Market 32, and Hannaford. There are two large Asian grocery stores in town: Asian Super Market and Asian Food Market. A smaller Korean Market (Kim's Asian Market) in Central offers good Korean snacks and drinks(recommender by Jeeyoung). There is also a Korean Market (Jang Tuh Asian Grocery) in Latham.

## Other

- If you plan to travel from Albany to New York City, apart from driving, Amtrak is also a good option. The Amtrak train station is in Rensselaer (about 10 minutes drive from the downtown campus). It takes about 2.5 hours to New York by train. Usually there will be discount for travels in New York State. See the Amtrak [Deals page](https://www.amtrak.com/promotions/deals.html) for details. With the discount the price is usually $45 for a single trip (it's cheaper during the pandemic). The advantage of taking a train is that you don't have to find a (freakingly expensive) parking lot in New York City and the view along the Hudson River is gorgeous. 
- You can watch free musicals and plays during summer in Washington Park. Visit the [Playhouse Stage Company](http://playhousestage.org/past-seasons) for more information.
